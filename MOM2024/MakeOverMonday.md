# Makeover Monday Visualizations - 2024

Welcome to my Makeover Monday visualization project for 2024! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through each week's Makeover Monday challenge. I will be posting my visualizations and insights here every week.

## About Makeover Monday
Makeover Monday is a weekly data visualization challenge where participants are tasked with redesigning an existing visualization to make it more effective, engaging, and insightful.

## Weekly Visualizations
Below is the list of weekly visualizations I've created for the Makeover Monday challenge. Each entry includes a brief description of the dataset, the visualization, and my thought process.

# Makeover Monday Visualizations - 2024

Welcome to my Makeover Monday visualization project for 2024! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through each week's Makeover Monday challenge. I will be posting my visualizations and insights here every week.

## About Makeover Monday
Makeover Monday is a weekly data visualization challenge where participants are tasked with redesigning an existing visualization to make it more effective, engaging, and insightful.
